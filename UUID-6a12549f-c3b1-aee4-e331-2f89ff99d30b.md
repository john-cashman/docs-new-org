###### Edit capacity allocation


After adding partner/category, you can allocate quantity using the drop-down menu corresponding to the partner/category.

It is not possible to assign capacity individually to . In this case, the capacity or free selling defined for the category will apply to all the partners in the category.

Free selling

When a partner or category is defined for free selling capacity, sales can be made up to the available capacity for the offer. For a detailed description on free selling capacity, refer [Capacity allocation](UUID-5fcbc2b4-dee7-2f72-d758-265d3f8bdc45.html)

Allocated

When you choose the option , you will be able to define the ticket quantity that will be allocated to the partner or category.

In case ticket quantity is allocated to a category, then all the partners in that category can collectively sell up to the defined quantity.

For example: The category Global partners having 2 partners is allocated 5000 tickets. This means both the partners in the category can collectively sell from the pool of 5000 tickets, irrespective of the total ticket quantity available for the offer, which in this case is 10,000 tickets.

It is possible that, for example, the category Global partner having one of the partners as Tickets Lane is allocated capacity 2000 tickets. Later, the partner Tickets Lane is individually allocated 500 tickets.

In this case, the partners in the category will be able to sell up to 2000 tickets and Tickets Lane will have the limit to sell up to 500 tickets. This means category capacity will be overwritten by the individual capacity for that partner. This is possible in vice-a-versa case as well.

Click after making the required changes.

It is possible to add or remove partners as well as edit the ticket quantity allocated among partners after the offer is put on sales.

The offer will be available to the partners as soon as it is published to them. The partner will be notified on his/her Enviso Trade for resellers account about it.

However, the offer sales will start as per the sales period defined for that offer.

A reselling partner can only consult the capacity allocation defined for him/her, and not of other partners who are assigned the offer.

In case an offer is not configured for a partner, that partner can visualise the offer from his/her trade for resellers account and send you a request to sell the offer.

When a partner sends you a request to sell an offer, you can accept or decline the request.
