# Quickstart


### Getting started


You’ll need a GitBook account to start publishing documentation. If you don’t already have an account, you can sign up for free [here](https://app.gitbook.com/join) .

### Create a docs site


When you first sign up, you’ll have a chance to create a docs site from the docs site wizard. You can launch the wizard again to create a new site at any point by clicking the button next to the header in the sidebar.

Publish your first site in just a few minutes using the docs site wizard.

The docs site wizard will take you through the flow of creating your first site. You’ll need to give your site a name, choose if you want to start from scratch with an empty site or add our sample content, and whether or not you want to publish your docs right away.

### Edit your content


Now that you’ve created a site, you can edit or import your content. If you have an existing repository on GitHub or GitLab with your documentation, you can easily migrate and sync your content to GitBook using [Git Sync](git-sync/) . Find out more in [our guide to migrating content using Git Sync](https://app.gitbook.com/s/LBGJKQic7BQYBXmVSjy0/product-guides/import-or-migrate-your-content-to-gitbook-with-git-sync) .

After importing your content, you can edit your pages using GitBook’s built-in editor and do things like [add interactive blocks](../creating-content/blocks/) , customize the [layout of your pages](../creating-content/content-structure/page.md) and more.

### Customize your site


Not only can you edit the content of your site, you can also customize many settings related to the look and feel of your site when it’s published.

You can change things like the [logo, colors & fonts](../publishing-documentation/customization.md) , add more structure through [site sections](../publishing-documentation/site-structure/site-sections.md) and [variants](../publishing-documentation/site-structure/variants.md) , or update your [site’s visibility](../publishing-documentation/site-settings.md#audience) settings.

You can read more about customizing your docs in the resources below:

### Publish your documentation


Finally, you’re ready to publish your site into the world. If you haven’t already published your site from the wizard, you can publish your site from your site’s dashboard at any time.

After publishing your site, you’ll get a link that you’re able to share with anyone!
