### Clone an offer


If you need to create a duplicate of a Ticket offer, you can clone it from the My offers page. Cloning enables you to duplicate an offer in Enviso, copying the original offer's [offer details](UUID-8855cfa0-26f4-c578-0a7d-7b044005f94c.html) , [tickets](UUID-7d765fa4-fd82-8ad0-0e83-915240616b6c.html) and [capacity](UUID-0eb4213b-f602-275c-d700-13b510ee3df9.html) , [additional configurations](/document/preview/135216#UUID-741ff62f-8d0a-8c70-3e54-1c2fcd6682ed) , [translations](UUID-43d2e5c5-938f-9c8d-cf57-36889df9c451.html) (if added), and access controls.
